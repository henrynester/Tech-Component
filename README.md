# Tech-Component
Ho Yeon Jeong, Henry Nester, & Aidan Witeck
This code will run on an Arduino Uno for our IBET Tech Component. It will run a science experiment by exposing Artema salinas to UV radiation at different duty cycles (25 or 50 percent). At the end of the experiment, a random sample of brine shrimp will have their length measured from each group. Our Tech Component also controls the temperature of the different treatment groups using a temperature probe immersed in a circulating water bath and a heating pad.
